### This exercise simulates the end-to-end claim lifecycle in Guidewire ClaimCenter.

âœ… Part 1: Claim Lifecycle â€“ Manual Walkthrough

Simulate and describe the following 8 stages:

1. Create a Claim â€“ Complete FNOL Activity

Actor: Customer Service Representative (CSR)

Goal: Capture initial claim details (date of loss, type of incident, insured info)

PCF Screen: FNOL wizard

Data Entity: Claim, LossDetails, Claimant

2. Setup Claim â€“ Post-FNOL Activities

System: Auto-triggers segmentation based on claim complexity

Output: Workplan generated

Adjuster: Updates or verifies FNOL details

Data Updated: Contact info, loss description, policy linkage

3. Create Exposures

Definition: Each exposure represents a potential liability/payment

Linked To: One claimant and one coverage

Created By: Automatically (based on rules) or manually by adjuster

Examples: Bodily injury, property damage, towing, etc.

4. Create Reserves

Definition: Amount set aside for potential claim payout

Type: Claim cost reserve or expense reserve

Created: Automatically via business rules or manually by adjuster

5. Complete Activities

Definition: Tasks created for adjusters to follow up

Can Be: Auto-created or manually assigned

Examples: Call insured, document upload, schedule inspection

6. Make Claim Payable

System State: All required data validated

Action: Mark claim as ready for payment

Trigger: Payment approval process begins

7. Issue Checks

Actor: Adjuster

Action: Payment issued to claimant, vendor, or third-party

Modes: One-time check or scheduled payment

8. Close the Claim

Requirements:

All exposures must be closed

All activities must be completed

No open services

Fault rating (if required) must be determined

ðŸŽ¨ Part 2: UI Customization â€“ Add Fields to Loss Details

Simulate adding these fields on the lossdetails.pcf screen:

Fields to Add:

First Name

Last Name

SSN Number

Date of Birth

ðŸ“„ Simulated PCF Snippet:

<PanelSet id="LossDetailsInputSet">
    <TextInput label="First Name" name="Loss_FirstName"/>
    <TextInput label="Last Name" name="Loss_LastName"/>
    <TextInput label="SSN Number" name="Loss_SSN"/>
    <DateInput label="Date of Birth" name="Loss_DOB"/>
</PanelSet>

Explanation:

These fields would be added to the LossDetails screen used during FNOL.

 may also need to add matching fields to the data model (Claim entity).

ðŸ§  Summary

This exercise helps practice:

Understanding claim lifecycle stages

Documenting behavior without system access

Simulating Guidewire UI and data structure logic

## ðŸ–¼ Mock FNOL Screen (Simulated)

This mock screen shows a simulated FNOL page with custom fields: First Name, Last Name, SSN, and Date of Birth.
