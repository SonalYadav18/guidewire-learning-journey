# 💸 Claim Recovery in ClaimCenter

During the lifecycle of a claim, insurers may attempt to **recover funds** from third parties who are responsible for the loss. ClaimCenter supports two primary recovery methods:

---

## 🔁 1. Subrogation

Subrogation is the process where the **insurance company seeks reimbursement** from a third party (often another insurer or at-fault party).

### 📌 Example:
- A customer’s car is damaged in an accident caused by someone else.
- The insurer pays the customer’s repair cost.
- Later, the insurer **recovers that amount from the at-fault driver’s insurance**.

### 💼 ClaimCenter Features:
- Subrogation claims are tracked under the original claim.
- Supports negotiation, demand letters, and third-party communication.

## 🚗 2. Salvage

Salvage is the process of **recovering value from damaged property** that was paid out in a claim.

### 📌 Example:
- A car is totaled in an accident.
- The insurer pays the insured the full value of the car.
- The insurer takes ownership of the damaged vehicle and **sells it for scrap** or auction — this is salvage.

### 💼 ClaimCenter Features:
- Tracks salvageable items under the claim.
- Supports integration with salvage vendors or in-house recovery teams.

## 🧠 Summary

| Method        | Description |
|---------------|-------------|
| **Subrogation** | Recover money from a liable third party |
| **Salvage**     | Recover value from damaged items that the insurer paid for |

Recovery helps reduce claim costs and improve profitability while maintaining service to the insured.

Note: "Totaled" (short for "total loss") means:
The cost to repair the damaged item (usually a car) is more than its actual value, so the insurer decides not to repair it.
