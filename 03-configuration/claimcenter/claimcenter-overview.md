# 🧾 Guidewire ClaimCenter – Overview

## 📌 What is ClaimCenter?

**Guidewire ClaimCenter** is a claims management system used by insurance companies to process insurance claims across their lifecycle.

It allows:
- **Customer Service Representatives (CSRs)** to create and register claims
- **Claim Adjusters** to investigate, approve, or deny claims
- **Supervisors** to monitor claim activity, approvals, and team performance

---

## 🔁 Claim Lifecycle Stages in ClaimCenter

| Stage | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **1. Intake (FNOL)** | First Notice of Loss – when the customer or agent reports the claim |
| **2. Adjudication** | Investigation: setting up exposures, reserves, evaluating coverage |
| **3. Payment** | Issuing payments via checks to claimants, vendors, etc. |
| **4. Recovery** | Recovering funds from third parties (e.g., other insurers) or subrogation |
| **5. Closure** | Final step once all tasks and payments are completed |

---

## 🔍 Key Terms

### 🔹 Exposures
- Represent potential loss items under a claim (e.g., injury, property damage)
- Claims can have multiple exposures

### 🔹 Reserves
- Financial estimates of what the insurer expects to pay
- Helps control and track liabilities

### 🔹 Activities
- Tasks assigned to users (adjusters, supervisors)
- Include follow-ups, approvals, document checks, etc.

## 🔗 Policy Integration in ClaimCenter

ClaimCenter communicates with the **PolicyCenter** (or external policy system) at 3 key points:

1. **Initial Search** – When the claim is created, the system searches for the associated policy
2. **Retrieval** – Once policy is selected, coverage data is pulled into ClaimCenter
3. **Refresh** – Policy data is updated during the claim if it changes

This ensures **coverage verification** is accurate before paying claims.

## 🧠 Segmentation

**Segmentation** refers to how ClaimCenter determines the **complexity of a claim**:

- Simple claims (e.g., windshield repair) may be processed automatically
- Complex claims (e.g., total loss car accident) may require multiple approvals and documentation

Segmentation affects:
- Assignment of adjusters
- Routing to workflows
- Rules applied

---

## 🧪 Typical Claim Workflow

1. FNOL entered by CSR
2. Policy verified
3. Claim assigned to adjuster
4. Exposures and reserves are created
5. Tasks (activities) are auto-generated
6. Payments are approved and issued
7. Claim is reviewed and closed
