## Entities in data model
An entity is a business object used by an application
Entities are defined in ETI files.

## Base application entities
Application entities are specific to application
Platform entities are common to all Guidewire applications

Entities with the final equals true attribute defined in the etity element cannot be subtyped.
Entities with the extendable equals false attribute defined in the entity element cannot be extended in the sense that new elements cannot be added to the entity.

## Custom Entities
An entity created by the customer, theye are eti files, alwys name the entity suffix _Ext

## Entity Extension
use to - add fields, override certain attributes of existing fields safely, are defined in ETX files, may have only one ETX file,fields added to an entity extension should end with _Ext.

## Extending entities
The ETX file is created at the application level

## Internal Entity Extension
An internal entity extension is created by guidewire to add application specific functionality to a platform level entity .
An EIX file is local in the application and read only.

## Typelist
Typelist file names are defined as 
.TTI - Typelist Type Info -a single guidewire or custom typelist declaration
.TIX - Typelist Internal Extension - a single guidewire typelist extension 
.TTX - Typelist Type Extension - a single guidewire or custom typelist extension
Base application typelist are read only
allows customer to safely add new typecodes to base application typelist
te typelist extension is defined in a TTX file
A base application Typelist can hve utmost one  TTX file
For Typecodes that are added to a base app typelist , guidewire recommends the code should end with _Ext.

## Typelist in the data model
\Metadata\Typelist folder read only and contains platform and base application Typelists
\Extension \Typelist folder contains everything customer specific.
ValidationLevel is Extendble
ActivityStatus is internal
BuildingCode_Ext is custom
Virtual typelist does not exists as .tti files in studio
java code is generated
a table is populated on the db
virtul typleist behave like other typelist


## Explanation:
🧱 What Are Entities in Guidewire?

Think of Entities like data tables (like Excel sheets).
Each entity stores information.
For example:

A Claim entity stores claim details
A Policy entity stores policy details
A User entity stores people like adjusters or CSRs
Guidewire uses these entities to model the real-world data in an insurance system.

📁 Where Entities Are Defined

Entities are stored in files with these extensions:

File	What it means
.eti	The main file that defines an entity
.etx	A file used to add extra fields to an existing entity
.eix	A file Guidewire itself uses to add stuff — you can't change this

✅ Simple Example

Let’s say you want to store a person’s name and phone number.

You create an entity called Customer_Ext:

<entity name="Customer_Ext">
    <column name="Name" type="Varchar"/>
    <column name="Phone" type="Varchar"/>
</entity>
This is stored in a .eti file — your custom entity.

✏️ What if You Want to Add a Field to an Existing Entity?

Guidewire already has a Claim entity.

Now you want to add one new field — "Third Party Involved?"

You use an .etx file like this:

<extension entity="Claim">
    <column name="IsThirdParty_Ext" type="Boolean"/>
</extension>
This is a safe way to add new fields to Guidewire's built-in entities.

🎨 What Are Typelists?

Typelists are like dropdown lists.

For example:
LossCause dropdown might include:
FIRE
THEFT
ACCIDENT
These are stored in .tti or .ttx files.

.tti → Guidewire’s original dropdown list
.ttx → Your own added dropdown options (custom ones)
So you might add:

<typecode code="FLOOD_Ext"/>


🔑 Key Rules (Super Simple)
| You want to...           | Use this | End it with `_Ext`? |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------- |
| Create a new table       | `.eti`   | ✅ Yes               |
| Add a new field          | `.etx`   | ✅ Yes               |
| Add a new dropdown value | `.ttx`   | ✅ Yes               |


🎁 Summary in Plain English

Entities are like tables that store data.
Use .eti to create, .etx to extend.
Always end custom names with _Ext.
Typelists are for dropdown options like reasons or statuses.
